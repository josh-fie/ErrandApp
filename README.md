# Errand App

This project was developed with the React.js framework and incorporates React hooks, react router plugin and functional components. To view the deployed version of this app please visit: [errandapp.netlify](https://errandapp.netlify.app).

The errandapp provides a place whereby a user can add an errand to the errand list by clicking on the map at a destination. The Geolocation API is used to identify the user's location to center the map and Leaflet.js is used to handle clicks on the map to identify coordinates for destinations and add markers onto the map. 

The errands can individually be prioritised (flagged) and/or completed and the errand list can then be filtered via either priorities or completed. Priority and completed errands are colour-coded on the map.

A setting tab on the app provides the user with options to select Light mode and/or Large text for accessibility.
